        <p class="lead">It has been a long time coming. I've shed my blood, sweat and (tears). Now it is time to show it. I've been dabling with programming (Android DEV) for quite some time. Now I am ready to create my own stuff and
          the project that I chose is a workout app. The app that I like to use is called 7 Minute Workout (non-customizable) so I thought to myself, </p>

        <blockquote class="blockquote m-5">
          <p>"Why don't I create one app that people can use to create their own sets of workout and share them with others?"</p>
          <footer class="blockquote-footer">From Kimi's head</footer>
        </blockquote>

        <p class="lead">This is what I got. The app is called CHANGES. Users can create their own sets of workout and they'll be able to share them with others.
          I have my own biases when it comes to workout. For example, I like squats more than I like push-ups. Some people like pull-up more than plank. We all differs. I guess
          people are opiniated when it comes to certain things.</p>

        <p class="lead">Why don't I create a place where communities can share their Wout (workout) sets of exercise (whatever they may be). They can rate them or (whatever).
          And I think something is more important than that is Accountability. If I can provide a place where someone can share his/her goals and other people help keep them accountable
          to it. That is good enough for me.</p>

        <p class="lead">At the time of this writing, I've spent 3.5 weeks fiddling with app designs and landing page. I learned a bunch of other tools
        that could help me better execute this idea. Some of them are Figma, Gimp and Web Dev tools. I will take you through the journey of this app dev, so <strong>stay tuned.</strong></p>
