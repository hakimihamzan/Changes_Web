          I spent the rest 2 and a half week creating the landing page from scratch. Well, initially I use bootstrap, but then I couldn't (for the life of me) figure out
          why does the webpage break when it comes to 300px wide. It is not easy creating great looking landing page that is responsive. What I thought at first was ..</p>

        <p class="lead">Well, life kicks me down. That's what you get when you think you know. I learned my lessons well. I learned a ton about front-end dev.
          At the end, I also figured out what makes the bootstrap ver of the page breaks. And it is kind of fun. The whole web site is hosted on github and it is static.
          The website got a twist tho. It has a collection box for email. And this email is sent to the firebase database that I set up prior.</p>

        <p class="lead">I spent about a week creating the app designs using Figma that I have to learn from scratch. The designs are not final. I intend to follow closely material design principle, that's why most of the components you see
        in the app screenshot looks kind of like a card put on paper 3D-ly</p>

        </blockquote>

        <p class="lead">This is what I got. The app is called CHANGES. Users can create their own sets of workout and they'll be able to share them with others.
          I have my own biases when it comes to workout. For example, I like squats more than I like push-ups. Some people like pull-up more than plank. We all differs. I guess
          people are opiniated when it comes to certain things.</p>

        <p class="lead">Why don't I create a place where communities can share their Wout (workout) sets of exercise (whatever they may be). They can rate them or (whatever).
          And I think something is more important than that is Accountability. If I can provide a place where someone can share his/her goals and other people help keep them accountable
          to it. That is good enough for me.</p>

        <p class="lead">At the time of this writing, I've spent 3.5 weeks fiddling with app designs and landing page. I learned a bunch of other tools
          that could help me better execute this idea. Some of them are Figma, Gimp and Web Dev tools. I will take you through the journey of this app dev, so <strong>stay tuned.</strong></p> -->

        <p class="lead">Early screen shot of the landing page was also created in Figma. But I guess a little different from the original because I had to do some tweaking around. I am a really mediocre web developer. I can make a website work if you
          need me to but it is going to take a while (2.5 weeks delay) Android dev is more my food and drinks.
